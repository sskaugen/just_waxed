This is a little project that I am making to help my mother accurately calculate the weekly pay to her employees. I am using object orientated python and plan to create a easy and simple GUI to faciliate the data entry. The first run of this application will more then likey work from the console. I plan on tying this with another application to store the data in a database for easy data tracking and documentation.
